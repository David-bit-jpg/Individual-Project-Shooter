# Individual-Project-Shooter

##This is my first unity project. In this project, I made this game by following the instruction on Udemy. I modified it by simplifying it to focus on the core features. It has a topdown view with different weapon designs, so that players can collect and kill enemies with different kinds of weapons. Itâ€™s my first Unity project so it contains a lot of fundamental knowledge like action map, tile plate and basic 2D collider implementations. It also covers a lot of coding skills like applying animation, adding event system, and sounds.
